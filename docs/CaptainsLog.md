## What we did

### Started SCRUMing

We have started using the SCRUM method for our work, but lightly. We do

* Stand-up-meetings
* Roles (Scrummaster and product owner)

We created a backlog and prioritized it.

### Decided on working rules

We decided on ground rules to work well together.

* Be on time for everything scheduled.
* Notify as soon as you believe you might be delayed for something scheduled.
* Minimize administration. Don't book meetings other than stand-up and mission critical meetings. Remove rather than add.
* Use the calendar restrictively.

We decided a framework for our Scrumming

* A sprint is 5 days.
* Deadline for sprints are 14:00 on Fridays.
* Stand up every weekday. Time and place are in the calendar. 

### Concept development

We developed the concept

## Problems encountered

### Scrumming

Differing schedules: how can we use SCRUM to deliver even though we don't always sit together?

### Working rules

What is the consequence of breaking a rule? We discussed it breifly. We came up with "no consequence". They are about respect, not punishments. 

The people who are at a scheduled meeting at a scheduled time can make the decisions in that meeting. If you miss it, you lose your say in that issue.
