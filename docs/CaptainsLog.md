Sprint planning
---------------

We planned a sprint. We realized it was hard to not get into techincal details. There are some major issues with having to work distributed. Code standards is one. Coming up with good ways to work on one thing without waiting for another to get done first is another. Slicing is hard.

Estimation is really hard as well. We chose a baseline that seemed reasonable, but estimating other stuff from that baseline was difficult, since everyone had a very different idea of how much work the baseline would actually be. That distorts everything. Using planning poker helps, it gets a conversation started.

I'm scared of the concept of having a product owner as a developer. It feels like the product owner can be persuaded by impletentation aspects. We really should introduce a PO hat or something.

## What we did

### Started SCRUMing

We have started using the SCRUM method for our work, but lightly. We do

* Stand-up-meetings
* Roles (Scrummaster and product owner)

We created a backlog and prioritized it.

### Decided on working rules

We decided on ground rules to work well together.

* Be on time for everything scheduled.
* Notify as soon as you believe you might be delayed for something scheduled.
* Minimize administration. Don't book meetings other than stand-up and mission critical meetings. Remove rather than add.
* Use the calendar restrictively.

We decided a framework for our Scrumming

* A sprint is 5 days.
* Deadline for sprints are 14:00 on Fridays.
* Stand up every weekday. Time and place are in the calendar. 

### Concept development

We developed the concept

## Problems encountered

### Scrumming

Differing schedules: how can we use SCRUM to deliver even though we don't always sit together?

### Working rules

What is the consequence of breaking a rule? We discussed it breifly. We came up with "no consequence". They are about respect, not punishments. 

The people who are at a scheduled meeting at a scheduled time can make the decisions in that meeting. If you miss it, you lose your say in that issue.
