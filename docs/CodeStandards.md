# The coding style guide for Alive & Clickin'
Our code standards are based on [Airbnb's code standards](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), with some modifications
## Comments
- All methods, excluding basic getters and setters, should be documented using Javadoc
 - Inline comments should be used whenever something out of the ordinary is present. Comments should be written above the code they're relevant to.
