# Pass the parcel rules

## Rules

Passing a parcel around, wrapped in several layers of wrapping. The parcel is apssed around, until something happens (the music stops, for example). When this happens, a layer is unwrapped. If it is the last layer, the contents are revelaed and the player who unwrapped the last layer gets to keep the item.

## Adapting for busses.

Quite simply, when you get of the bus, a layer is unwrapped. Or, when a certain number of kilometres are covered, a leayer is unwrapped, but you don't find out until you get of the bus.

Different parcels have different requirements:
* Must be kept warm!
    * Rub it if ambient temperature is too cold.
    * Can be improved by having certain items, like matches or gloves.
* Fragile!
    * Hold it carefully, don't let the phone bounce to quickly (use the gyroscope to garantuee this).
    * Can be improved by items like pillows.
* Urgent!
    * Has few layers, but can't be left for too long.
* Keep upright!
    * When there's a turn signal, you are alerted. Turn the phone to match the turning direction.
* Stir it!
    * The parcel can't be too still
